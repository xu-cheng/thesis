With the recent advances in data-as-a-service (DaaS) and cloud computing, outsourcing data to the cloud has become the common practice. In a typical scenario, the data owner (DO) outsources the data and delegates the query processing service to the service provider (SP). However, as the SP is often an untrusted third party, the integrity of the query results cannot be guaranteed and is thus imperative to be authenticated. To tackle this issue, a common paradigm is letting the SP provide a cryptographic proof, which can be used to verify the soundness and completeness of the query results by the clients.
Despite the extensive research on authenticated query processing for the outsourced database, existing techniques only consider supporting limited query types. They fail to address a variety of needs demanded by enterprise customers such as supporting aggregate queries over set-valued data, enforcing fine-grained access control, and conforming distributed environment.
In this dissertation, we take the first step to comprehensively investigate the authenticated query processing in the cloud that follows the aforementioned requirements.
Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed solutions and techniques are robust and efficient under a wide range of system settings.

\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:conclusions}

In this dissertation, we have tackled three kinds of query authentication problems, namely authentication of aggregate queries over set-valued data, authentication of relational queries with fine-grained access control, and authentication of {kNN} queries in distributed environment. They enables the DO outsourcing the data and query services to an untrusted third party cloud while still maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, they addresses a variety of needs demanded by enterprise customs such as supporting aggregate queries over set-valued data, enforcing fine-grained access control, and conforming distributed environment. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed solutions and techniques are robust and efficient under a wide range of system settings.

\section{Contributions}

The first contribution of this dissertation is the development of the query authentication algorithms that support aggregate queries over set-valued data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses both integrity and confidentiality for aggregate queries over set-valued data. We propose a privacy-preserving authentication framework and we develop a set of privacy-preserving authentication protocols and algorithms for various aggregate queries. Formal security analysis and cost models for the proposed authentication protocols and algorithms are also given. To further enhance the performance of query authentication algorithms, we propose several optimizations. Finally, we perform extensive performance evaluation on real-world datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of our proposals.

The second contribution of this dissertation is the study of combining query authentication and access control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on query authentication for databases with fine-grained access control. We believe that this is a timely study, as enterprise cloud database systems dictate integrity (query authentication) and authorization (access control) at the same time. We propose a novel ABS-based APP signature as the primitive for ADS, together with a grid-index-based tree structure that can aggregate APP signatures for efficient range and join query authentication. To further improve the query performance, we develop several optimization techniques that are either compatible with the original security model or a relaxed one. Furthermore, we conduct a security analysis and empirical study on the authentication performance with respect to various factors such as query range size and database cardinality.

The third contribution of this dissertation is an investigate authenticated kNN query processing in a distributed environment.We propose distributed MR-tree as an ADS to suit the distributed query processing environment. We develop a basic algorithm and two optimization techniques to efficiently process authenticated kNN queries in a distributed fashion. We also conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of the proposed techniques in terms of query cost, communication overhead, and verification time.

\section{Possible of Future Work}

As for future work, we plan to extend the proposed privacy-preserving authentication techniques developed in \Cref{chap:aggregate-queries} to more complex aggregate queries such as median and percentile. We also plan to leverage GPGPU technologies to accelerate the computation of accumulative values during query processing at the SP\@.

For the study of enforcing access control, we plan to extend the proposed techniques in \Cref{chap:access-control} to support more complex queries, such as aggregation. We also plan to study more challenging fine-grained query authentication problems for multi-source data in a distributed environment.

Finally, we plan to design a distributed spatial query authentication system to support more spatial queries and efficient data updates based on what we learn in \Cref{chap:knn}.

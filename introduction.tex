\section{Background}

With the recent advances in data-as-a-service (DaaS) and cloud computing, outsourcing data to the cloud has become the common practice. In a typical scenario shown in \Cref{fig:intro:model}, the \emph{data owner} (DO) outsources the data to a third party in the cloud known as \emph{service provider} (SP). Upon receiving the query requests from the clients, the SP will process them on the behavior of the DO\@. Since the SP has more computation power and storage capability than those of the DO, such cloud outsourcing paradigm is able to scale up the services with a low cost. However, as the SP is often a third-party delegate of the DO, it cannot be trusted. For example, the SP may return tampered or partial results due to a variety of reasons including service outages, hack attacks, or even corporate dishonesty. Therefore, it is important to authenticate the query results such that the clients can verify their soundness (all results are genuine) and completeness (no result is missing).

In the field of query processing, query authentication has been studied by a large body of literature~\cite{10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320027,10.1145/1142473.1142488,10.1007/s00778-008-0113-2,10.1145/1880022.1880026,10.1145/2213836.2213871,10.1145/2463676.2465281,10.14778/2732219.2732224,10.1145/2664243.2664244,10.1145/2723372.2747649,10.1109/tkde.2014.2316818}. The fundamental concept is that the DO signs a well-designed \emph{authenticated data structure} (ADS) as notarization of the outsourced data. Based on the ADS, the SP then constructs a cryptographic proof, known as \emph{verification object} (VO), for each query, and returns it along with the query results for the client to verify.

However, the prior works only consider supporting limited query types. They fail to address a variety of needs demanded by enterprise customers. For example, aggregate queries over set-valued data used in data analytics play an important role in domains such as business decision making, scientific research, and government policy. Yet, the majority of the existing query authentication algorithms focus on relational or spatial data and their associated query types. Further, none of the existing solutions considers the data confidentiality requirement, which is often needed in order to protect business secrets, preserve user privacy, and conform regulations. Similarly, access control, another important security concern, is also largely ignored by the existing works. Finally, most of the existing studies on query authentication are confined to a centralized environment. Little research is conducted to investigate authenticated query processing in a distributed setting.

To address these issues, in this dissertation, we take the first step to study three new problems, namely
\begin{inlineenum}
  \item authentication of aggregate queries over set-valued data,
  \item authentication of relational queries with fine-grained access control, and
  \item authentication of {kNN} queries in distributed environment.
\end{inlineenum}

\section{Authenticating Aggregate Queries over Set-Valued Data}

Aggregate query services over set-valued data are becoming widely available for business intelligence, scientific research, and government policy study. For example, personal genomics analysis (e.g., 23andMe and the Personal Genome Project (PGP) at Harvard Medical School~\cite{pgp}) is based on aggregate queries on large genome datasets, the integrity of whose results is vital. Below is one example:

\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    \textbf{PID} & \textbf{ZIP} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Mut-Genes}}\\
    \midrule
    P1&95014&A-C130R, P-I696M\\
    P2&20482&H-C282Y, P-P12A, R-G1886S \\
    P3&95014&A-C130R, U-G71R, W-R611H\\
    P4&01720&A-V2050L, H-C282Y, M-R52C, U-G71R\\
    P5&20134&A-C130R, P-P12A, R-G1886S, S-E366K\\
    P6&17868& C-R102G, R-G1886S\\
    P7&55410&C-R102G, C-Q1334H, S-E288V\\
    P8&20852&C-R102G, P-P12A, R-G1886S, K-T220M\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Set-Valued Genome Dataset}\label{tab:intro:sample_pgp}
\end{table}

\begin{example}[Aggregate Queries on PGP Data]~\label{example:intro:pgp}
  \Cref{tab:intro:sample_pgp} shows a sample genome dataset, where \emph{PID} is participant ID, \emph{ZIP} is ZIP code, and \emph{Mut-Genes} is a sensitive set-valued attribute that records the mutation genes of each participant.The query clients (e.g., medical doctors) may be interested in the following aggregate queries:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item \textbf{Q1}: Find the most common gene in the district of Cupertino, CA (ZIP\@: 95014).
      \item \textbf{Q2}: Count the number of participants who carry the gene `R-G1886S'.
      \item \textbf{Q3}: Find the most frequent genes with supports $\ge$ 3 in ZIPs 20***.
    \end{itemize}
    The corresponding query results are: \{`A-C130R'\}, 4, and \{`P-P12A', `R-G1886S'\}, respectively.
\end{example}
